OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is a computing approach used for complex multidimensional analysis of business data. It enables users to analyze different dimensions of data, such as time, geography, product, and customer, to gain insights for decision support and reporting. The architecture of OLAP typically involves a multidimensional data model, data storage, and query processing.

### OLAP Architecture Components

1. **Multidimensional Data Model**
   - **Concept**: OLAP systems use a multidimensional data model, representing data in a structure with multiple dimensions, such as time, geography, and product.
   - **Key Concepts**: The model consists of dimensions (e.g., time, product, customer) and measures (e.g., sales, profit) and enables complex analysis through slicing, dicing, drilling, and pivoting.

2. **OLAP Server**
   - **Concept**: The OLAP server is the central component responsible for storing and managing multidimensional data, often utilizing a star or snowflake schema for data modeling.
   - **Key Concepts**: OLAP servers support fast query performance for complex operations and are optimized for analytical queries and reporting.

3. **OLAP Cube**
   - **Concept**: OLAP cubes are multi-dimensional datasets that store quantitative data aggregated by multiple dimensions and are used for analysis and reporting.
   - **Key Concepts**: Cubes provide a pre-aggregated view of data, enabling rapid query response times for multidimensional analysis.

4. **Data Storage**
   - **Concept**: OLAP systems require efficient storage mechanisms for multidimensional data, often using specialized databases designed for analytical processing.
   - **Key Concepts**: Data is organized in a way that optimizes query performance for complex analytical operations and reporting.

5. **Query Processing Engine**
   - **Concept**: OLAP query processing engines are designed to handle complex multidimensional queries, enabling users to analyze data from different dimensions efficiently.
   - **Key Concepts**: These engines support operations such as roll-up, drill-down, slice-and-dice, and pivoting for interactive analysis.

6. **Client Tools**
   - **Concept**: OLAP client tools provide user interfaces for querying and analyzing multidimensional data, often through visualizations and dashboards.
   - **Key Concepts**: These tools enable business users to interact with OLAP data for decision support, reporting, and ad-hoc analysis.

### OLAP Architecture Overview
