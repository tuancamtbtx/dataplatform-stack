# Streaming Transform
## Compare Flink vs Spark
Apache Flink and Apache Spark are both powerful distributed computing frameworks designed for processing large-scale data in real-time and batch modes. Here's a comparison of the two frameworks based on key features and use cases:

### Apache Flink

#### Key Features:
1. **Real-time Processing**: Flink is designed from the ground up for real-time stream processing, providing low-latency and high-throughput processing with support for event-time processing and watermarks.
2. **Stateful Computations**: Flink has built-in support for stateful stream processing, making it suitable for complex event-driven applications and maintaining application state.
3. **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Flink natively supports end-to-end exactly-once processing, ensuring consistency and fault-tolerance in stream processing.
4. **Complex Event Processing (CEP)**: Flink provides a rich set of APIs for complex event processing, including pattern matching and temporal operators.

#### Use Cases:
- Flink is well-suited for scenarios that require low-latency, high-throughput stream processing, such as real-time analytics, fraud detection, monitoring, and complex event processing.

### Apache Spark

#### Key Features:
1. **Unified Analytics Engine**: Spark offers a unified platform for batch processing, interactive queries, machine learning, and streaming analytics, providing a versatile environment for various data processing needs.
2. **Structured Streaming**: Spark provides structured streaming, a high-level API for stream processing that seamlessly integrates with the Spark SQL engine, allowing users to write batch-like queries on streaming data.
3. **Machine Learning and Graph Processing**: Spark includes libraries for machine learning (MLlib) and graph processing (GraphX), enabling users to perform advanced analytics and data processing.

#### Use Cases:
- Spark is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data warehousing, machine learning, and interactive analytics. It is often used for scenarios where a versatile and unified data processing engine is required.

### Comparison Summary

#### Stream Processing:
- Flink is well-suited for low-latency, high-throughput stream processing with strong support for event-time processing and stateful computations.
- Spark offers structured streaming, which provides a high-level API for stream processing and is suitable for use cases where a unified processing engine for batch
