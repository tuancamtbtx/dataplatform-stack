# DATA TRANSFROMATION STREAMING - SPARK

When working with data transformation streaming in Apache Spark, it's important to understand the core concepts of Spark's structured streaming and how to apply transformations to process real-time data. Here are some key documents and resources to help you get started with data transformation streaming in Apache Spark:

### Official Apache Spark Documentation
1. **Structured Streaming Programming Guide**: The official Spark documentation provides a comprehensive guide to structured streaming, explaining the core concepts, data sources and sinks, event-time processing, and various transformation operations.
   - [Structured Streaming Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html)

2. **Transformations and Actions**: Understand the various transformations and actions available in structured streaming, such as `select`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `agg`, `window`, and `join`, to process and transform streaming data.
