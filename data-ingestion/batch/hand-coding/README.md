# Hand Coding - Batch Data Ingestion

When it comes to hand-coding batch data ingestion, you have several options depending on the specific requirements and the environment you're working in. Below is a high-level overview of the process for hand-coding batch data ingestion:

### 1. Data Source Identification
Identify the source of the data you want to ingest. This could be files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) stored in cloud storage, data from a relational database, or data from other sources.

### 2. Data Extraction
Write code to extract the data from the source. This could involve using libraries or tools specific to the data source, such as Python's `pandas` or `csv` libraries for CSV files, or JDBC/ODBC drivers for relational databases.

### 3. Data Transformation (Optional)
Perform any necessary data transformation. This could include cleaning and conforming the data to a common format, filtering out irrelevant data, or enriching the data with additional information.

### 4. Data Loading
Write code to load the extracted and transformed data into the target destination. This could involve using SQL for relational databases, or libraries such as `boto3` for AWS S3, or `google-cloud-storage` for Google Cloud Storage.

### 5. Error Handling and Logging
Implement error handling to capture and handle any issues that occur during the ingestion process. Logging should also be implemented to capture the process and any errors for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

### Example using Python and CSV Data

Below is a simplified example of batch data ingestion using Python to read data from CSV files and load it into a PostgreSQL database:

```python
import psycopg2
import csv

# Connect to PostgreSQL
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=postgres password=secret")
cur = conn.cursor()

# Read data from CSV
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header
    for row in reader:
        cur.execute(
            "INSERT INTO my_table (col1, col2) VALUES (%s, %s)",
            (row[0], row[1])
        )

# Commit and close connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

In this example, we read data from a CSV file and insert it into a PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library for PostgreSQL interaction and the built-in `csv` library for reading the CSV file.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider error handling, logging, performance optimization, and other best practices based on your specific use case and requirements. Additionally, when working with large-scale data ingestion, you might want to consider using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or batch processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Apache Beam.
